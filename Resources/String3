Custom code allow only AutoIt code of course.
If you're a dev you may use it fine maybe, in a negative case you may find some function that you need on Google.
If you don't find what you need, you can contact me, if you're looking about a public and easy function, I'll do it free.
In the case where you need a more advanced function and it need time, you'll need  to pay a bit of money, it will depend of what you ask of course.
